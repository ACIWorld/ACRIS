# ACI World Aviation Community Recommended Information Services (ACRIS) Working Group
## About ACRIS
ACI’s Aviation Community Recommended Information Services, known as ACRIS, sets the standard for information and data exchange in the aviation community, helping airports meet the demands of today and the future. ACRIS defines a framework for airports, airlines, partners and suppliers to share data across different companies and providers.

The definition and implementation of standardized business processes and interoperable IT solutions is a vital issue for the global aviation industry, especially as a way to improve efficiency and to increase revenues. This is not only valid within one stakeholder group (e.g., airlines), but also between different groups such as airlines and airports. The ACI Aviation Community Recommended Information Services (ACRIS) Working Group (WG) is focused on providing these solutions.

Regardless of their size and structure, airports operate in a complex, changing and challenging environment. Independent from global situations with constantly growing numbers or challenging crises, it’s important to share data with Airports, Airlines and companies. The data sharing considers several use cases like providing public data regarding flights, waiting times or airport facilities as well as nonpublic operational data regarding process or loading information.

ACI World has developed for its members and the wider aviation community the “Aviation Community Recommended Information Services” (ACRIS) working group, to provide the data standards that can help airports meet the demands of today and the future. ACRIS is central to efficient airport operations and develops global airport standards such as the ACRIS Semantic Model, which complements similar standards from other aviation organizations such as the IATA Airline Industry Data Model (AIDM) and the ICAO/SESAR ATM Information Reference Model (AIRM).

To be successful, each service in a collection of information services should be consistent with every other service and should be based on a common understanding of the airport business. Planning and prioritizing of service definitions will benefit from this common understanding. The ACRIS Semantic Model1 provides the platform for this.

The ACRIS Semantic Model has a number of layers, comprising the airport vocabulary of business terms. The knowledge layer contains the main concepts that are of interest to an airport and its partners. The data element library layer contains detailed information on the data items, including standard naming conventions. A technology realization layer represents the components such as message interface schemas (e.g. XML Schema Definitions (XSDs) or JSON schemas), data models for information exchange (e.g. Re-source Description Framework (RDF)), rich semantic languages (e.g. Web Ontology Language (OWL)) and database schemas.
